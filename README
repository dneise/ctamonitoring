This repositoy contains tools for performing the monitoring of the Cherenkov 
Telescope Array (CTA) instruments.
It is based in the Alma Common Software (ACS), 
a CORBA-based Container/Component framework. 

The repositoru cintains the property recorder package.  
The Property Recorder is a python tool that allows to scan an ACS deployment,
identify the components, their properties and create monitors on these
properties. These monitors will transfer the monitored measurements to
a backend that will take care of storing the data.
I works with the three ACS implementation language components.
The property recorder can operate in two modes: as a simple client application or 
as an ACS component.
